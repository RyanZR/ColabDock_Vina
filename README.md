# **LABODOCK**

> **NOTE:**
> New version of molecular docking and virtual screening notebooks are coming up. \
> In the meantime, the below notebooks were supported until then. 

LABODOCK is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks created in Google Colab to perform molecular docking, virtual screening and protein-ligand interaction analysis interactively and dynamically.
